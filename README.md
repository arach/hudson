**Build your app. HudsonKit supplies the workspace around it.**

Navigation, side panels, command palettes, status bars, draggable windows, and an infinite canvas. Compose them into a single-app shell or a workspace where several apps share the same chrome. Your app owns its state and content; the shell handles the surrounding interface.

## Built with HudsonKit

[![ARC’s live diagram editor: connected architecture nodes on a canvas, with an inspector, drawing tools, and status bar.](./docs/images/arc-showcase.png)](https://hudsonkit.com/arc/)

**[ARC](https://hudsonkit.com/arc/)** is a diagram editor built on HudsonKit’s `AppShell`. ARC supplies the diagram model, drawing tools, and inspector content; Hudson supplies the shell that holds them together. The screenshot shows the running editor with its built-in example diagram.

## Start building

```sh
bun add hudsonkit
```

Import the prebuilt styles once in your app entry point:

```tsx
import 'hudsonkit/styles';
```

A plain React component can become a Hudson app:

```tsx
'use client';

import { AppShell, createEmbedApp } from 'hudsonkit/app-shell';

const { app } = createEmbedApp({
  id: 'hello',
  title: 'My first app',
  component: () => <div style={{ padding: 24 }}>Hello, Hudson.</div>,
});

export default function Page() {
  return <AppShell app={app} />;
}
```

For an app with its own state, panels, and commands, implement `HudsonApp`: a **Provider** owns state, **slots** supply content, and **hooks** connect commands, search, and status to the shell. Follow the [quickstart](./docs/quickstart.md) or the [building apps guide](./docs/building-apps.md).

The web SDK targets React 19. Install a published package or a sealed tarball when consuming it outside this repository. See the [consumer setup rules](./AGENTS.md#consuming-hudsonkit-externally) for Next.js and Tailwind configuration.

## Choose your surface

| Surface | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| **`AppShell`** | One app with navigation, panels, commands, and status. |
| **`WorkspaceShell`** | Multiple apps in a shared canvas or panel workspace. |
| **Canvas and windows** | Pan, zoom, drag, resize, and persist window positions. |
| **Optional AI backends** | Provider-neutral AI integration through [`@hudsonkit/ai`](./docs/ai.md). |
| **Apple-native SDKs** | Swift packages for [macOS shells](./docs/macos-shell.md), [iOS shells](./docs/ios-shell.md), and [Hudson Canvas](./docs/hudson-canvas.md). |

This repository includes the SDKs, the web workspace, developer tools, and **Canvas**, a native macOS app for terminals and workspace artifacts.

## Work on Hudson

```sh
git clone https://github.com/arach/hudson.git
cd hudson
bun install
bun dev
```

Open [localhost:3500](http://localhost:3500) for the web workspace. For the native Canvas app, see [Hudson Canvas](./docs/hudson-canvas.md).
